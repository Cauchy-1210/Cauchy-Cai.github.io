I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Communication Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). My research interests primarily focus on the Internet of Things (IoT), Vehicular Networks, Machine Learning, Industry 4.0, and AI Agent Development. At present, I am undertaking an internship as an AI Algorithm Engineer at Geely, where I contribute to the development and optimization of GeelyAI.

I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering (First-Class Honours) in Communication Engineering from the University of Sussex in 2025, where I was awarded the Dean’s Medal (Dean’s List) for academic excellence. My undergraduate studies were supervised by Professor [Sheng Zhengguo](profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p355346-zhengguo-sheng).
